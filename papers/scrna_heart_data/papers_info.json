    "summary": "Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a groundbreaking\ntechnology extensively utilized in biological research, facilitating the\nexamination of gene expression at the individual cell level within a given\ntissue sample. While numerous tools have been developed for scRNA-seq data\nanalysis, the challenge persists in capturing the distinct features of such\ndata and replicating virtual datasets that share analogous statistical\nproperties. Results: Our study introduces a generative approach termed\nscRNA-seq Diffusion Transformer (scRDiT). This method generates virtual\nscRNA-seq data by leveraging a real dataset. The method is a neural network\nconstructed based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and\nDiffusion Transformers (DiTs). This involves subjecting Gaussian noises to the\nreal dataset through iterative noise-adding steps and ultimately restoring the\nnoises to form scRNA-seq samples. This scheme allows us to learn data features\nfrom actual scRNA-seq samples during model training. Our experiments, conducted\non two distinct scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrate superior performance.\nAdditionally, the model sampling process is expedited by incorporating\nDenoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). scRDiT presents a unified\nmethodology empowering users to train neural network models with their unique\nscRNA-seq datasets, enabling the generation of numerous high-quality scRNA-seq\nsamples.

    "summary": "The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to\nstudy complex biological systems and diseases with high resolution. The central\nchallenge is synthesizing enough scRNA-seq samples; insufficient samples can\nimpede downstream analysis and reproducibility. While various methods have been\nattempted in past research, the resulting scRNA-seq samples were often of poor\nquality or limited in terms of useful specific cell subpopulations. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel method called Single-Cell Latent Diffusion\n(SCLD) based on the Diffusion Model. This method is capable of synthesizing\nlarge-scale, high-quality scRNA-seq samples, including both 'holistic' or\ntargeted specific cellular subpopulations within a unified framework. A\npre-guidance mechanism is designed for synthesizing specific cellular\nsubpopulations, while a post-guidance mechanism aims to enhance the quality of\nscRNA-seq samples. The SCLD can synthesize large-scale and high-quality\nscRNA-seq samples for various downstream tasks. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance in cell classification and data\ndistribution distances when evaluated on two scRNA-seq benchmarks.\nAdditionally, visualization experiments show the SCLD's capability in\nsynthesizing specific cellular subpopulations.",

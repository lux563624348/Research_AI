    "summary": "Cells are the fundamental unit of biological organization, and identifying\nthem in imaging data - cell segmentation - is a critical task for various\ncellular imaging experiments. While deep learning methods have led to\nsubstantial progress on this problem, models that have seen wide use are\nspecialist models that work well for specific domains. Methods that have\nlearned the general notion of \"what is a cell\" and can identify them across\ndifferent domains of cellular imaging data have proven elusive. In this work,\nwe present CellSAM, a foundation model for cell segmentation that generalizes\nacross diverse cellular imaging data. CellSAM builds on top of the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) by developing a prompt engineering approach to mask\ngeneration. We train an object detector, CellFinder, to automatically detect\ncells and prompt SAM to generate segmentations. We show that this approach\nallows a single model to achieve state-of-the-art performance for segmenting\nimages of mammalian cells (in tissues and cell culture), yeast, and bacteria\ncollected with various imaging modalities. To enable accessibility, we\nintegrate CellSAM into DeepCell Label to further accelerate human-in-the-loop\nlabeling strategies for cellular imaging data. A deployed version of CellSAM is\navailable at https://label-dev.deepcell.org/.",

    "summary": "Cell segmentation and tracking in microscopy images are of great significance\nto new discoveries in biology and medicine. In this study, we propose a novel\napproach to combine cell segmentation and cell tracking into a unified\nend-to-end deep learning based framework, where cell detection and segmentation\nare performed with a current instance segmentation pipeline and cell tracking\nis implemented by integrating Siamese Network with the pipeline. Besides,\ntracking performance is improved by incorporating spatial information into the\nnetwork and fusing spatial and visual prediction. Our approach was evaluated on\nthe DeepCell benchmark dataset. Despite being simple and efficient, our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both cell segmentation and\ncell tracking accuracies.",

    "summary": "Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in\nmicroscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to\nspecific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyper-parameters\nin different experimental settings. Here, we present a multi-modality cell\nsegmentation benchmark, comprising over 1500 labeled images derived from more\nthan 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a\nTransformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing\nmethods but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging\nplatforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark\nand the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and\nversatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging.",

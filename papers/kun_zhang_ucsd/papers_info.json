    "summary": "We revisit Popper's falsifiability criterion. A tester hires a potential\nexpert to produce a theory, offering payments contingent on the observed\nperformance of the theory. We argue that if the informed expert can acquire\nadditional information, falsifiability does have the power to identify\nworthless theories.",

    "summary": "In this note, we prove that if a compact even dimensional manifold $M^{n}$\nwith negative sectional curvature is homotopic to some compact space-like\nmanifold $N^{n}$, then the Euler characteristic number of $M^{n}$ satisfies\n$(-1)^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\chi(M^{n})>0$. We also show that the minimal volume\nconjecture of Gromov is true for all compact even dimensional space-like\nmanifolds.",

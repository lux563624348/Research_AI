    "summary": "In this study, we analyze discordance between the transcriptome and proteome\nusing paired scRNA-Seq and multiplexed spatial proteomics data from HuBMAP. Our\nfindings highlight persistent transcripts in key immune markers, including\nCD45-RO, Ki67, CD45, CD20, and HLA-DR. CD45-RO is consistently expressed in\nmemory T cells, while Ki67, associated with cell proliferation, also displays\nsustained expression. Furthermore, HLA-DR, part of the MHC class II molecules,\ndemonstrates continuous expression, possibly crucial for APCs to trigger an\neffective immune response. This investigation provides novel insights into the\ncomplexity of gene expression regulation and protein function.",

    "summary": "The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Human Biomolecular Atlas Program\n(HuBMAP) aims to create a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of all the cells\nin the healthy human body. Multiple laboratories across the United States are\ncollecting tissue specimens from different organs of donors who vary in sex,\nage, and body size. Integrating and harmonizing the data derived from these\nsamples and 'mapping' them into a common three-dimensional (3D) space is a\nmajor challenge. The key to making this possible is a 'Common Coordinate\nFramework' (CCF), which provides a semantically annotated, 3D reference system\nfor the entire body. The CCF enables contributors to HuBMAP to 'register'\nspecimens and datasets within a common spatial reference system, and it\nsupports a standardized way to query and 'explore' data in a spatially and\nsemantically explicit manner. [...] This paper describes the construction and\nusage of a CCF for the human body and its reference implementation in HuBMAP.\nThe CCF consists of (1) a CCF Clinical Ontology, which provides metadata about\nthe specimen and donor (the 'who'); (2) a CCF Semantic Ontology, which\ndescribes 'what' part of the body a sample came from and details anatomical\nstructures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B); and (3) a CCF Spatial\nOntology, which indicates 'where' a tissue sample is located in a 3D coordinate\nsystem. An initial version of all three CCF ontologies has been implemented for\nthe first HuBMAP Portal release. It was successfully used by Tissue Mapping\nCenters to semantically annotate and spatially register 48 kidney and spleen\ntissue blocks. The blocks can be queried and explored in their clinical,\nsemantic, and spatial context via the CCF user interface in the HuBMAP Portal.",

    "summary": "Single cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) is a powerful\nmethod for recovering gene expression data from an exponentially scalable\nnumber of individual cells or nuclei. However, sci-RNA-seq is a complex\nprotocol that has historically exhibited variable performance on different\ntissues, as well as lower sensitivity than alternative methods. Here we report\na simplified, optimized version of the three-level sci-RNA-seq protocol that is\nfaster, higher yield, more robust, and more sensitive, than the original\nsci-RNA-seq3 protocol, with reagent costs on the order of 1 cent per cell or\nless. We showcase the optimized protocol via whole organism analysis of an\nE16.5 mouse embryo, profiling ~380,000 nuclei in a single experiment. Finally,\nwe introduce a \"tiny sci-*\" protocol for experiments where input is extremely\nlimited.",

    "summary": "Zebrafish are an ideal system to study the effect(s) of chemical, genetic,\nand environmental perturbations on development due to their high fecundity and\nfast growth. Recently, single cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to\nmeasure the effect of these perturbations at a whole embryo scale. These types\nof experiments rely on the ability to isolate nuclei from a large number of\nindividually barcoded zebrafish embryos in parallel. Here we report a method\nfor efficiently isolating high-quality nuclei from zebrafish embryos in a\n96-well plate format by bead homogenization in a lysis buffer. Through\nhead-to-head sciPlex-RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that this method\nrepresents a substantial improvement over enzymatic dissociation and that it is\ncompatible with a wide range of developmental stages.",

We prove that generalized Hopf-Cole transformations are\nsymplectic submersions in the Wasserstein symplectic geometry. Many examples,\nincluding a Hopf-Cole transformation for the shallow water equations, are\ngiven. Based on this transformation, energy splitting inequalities are\nprovided.",

The\ntemperature dependence of the harmonics of the susceptibility have been\nnumerically simulated with these two models, and we studied them as a function\nof the frequency, in terms of Cole-Cole plots. From our analysis we show that\nit is possible to distinguish between the two different phases, because of\ntheir clear differences in the Cole-Cole plots behaviour with the frequency.",

    "summary": "Recently, a new model of propagation of the light through the so-called\nweakly three-dimensional Cole-Cole nonlinear medium with short-range\nnonlocality has been proposed. In particular, it has been shown that in the\ngeometrical optics limit, the model is integrable and it is governed by the\ndispersionless Veselov-Novikov (dVN) equation.\n  Burgers-Hopf equation can be obtained as 1+1-dimensional reduction of dVN\nequation. We discuss its properties in the specific context of nonlinear\ngeometrical optics. An illustrative explicit example is considered.",

    "summary": "Virtual screening plays a pivotal role in early drug discovery, traditionally\ndominated by physics-based methods. While these approaches offer detailed\ninsights, they are often hindered by high computational costs, limited\nsampling, and forcefield inaccuracies. Advances in Machine Learning (Ml)and\nDeep Learning (DL) present resource-efficient alternatives, with approaches\nlike predictive geometric ML (EQUIBIND) and generative geometric ML\n(DIFFDOCK)showing promise in enhancing both efficiency and predictive\ncapability. Here, we compare these two strategies, retrospectively and\nprospectively, for identifying novel agonists targeting the dopamine D2\nreceptor. To complement DIFFDOCK's dual functionality in protein-ligand\nconformer generation and confidence estimation, we adopted a complementary\natom-type-based confidence model for EQUIBIND. This pipeline, termed the\ndiscriminative model, integrates a featurization step and an XGBoost classifier\nto differentiate between active and inactive ligands. The top-ranked compounds\nfrom both models were evaluated using an ultrafast dopaminergic biosensor\nassay, dLight. Our results demonstrate that the generative model achieved a\nhigher hit rate, notably leading to the discovery of Compound 1, a nanomolar\ndopamine D2 receptor agonist with a novel scaffold.",

    "summary": "Dynamics and functions of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are accurately\nregulated by the type of ligands that bind to the orthosteric or allosteric\nbinding sites. To glean the structural and dynamical origin of ligand-dependent\nmodulation of GPCR activity, we performed total $\\sim$ 5 $\\mu$sec molecular\ndynamics simulations of A$_{2A}$ adenosine receptor (A$_{2A}$AR) in its apo,\nantagonist-bound, and agonist-bound forms in an explicit water and membrane\nenvironment, and examined the corresponding dynamics and correlation between\nthe 10 key structural motifs that serve as the allosteric hotspots in\nintramolecular signaling network. We dubbed these 10 structural motifs \"binary\nswitches\" as they display molecular interactions that switch between two\ndistinct states. By projecting the receptor dynamics on these binary switches\nthat yield $2^{10}$ microstates, we show that (i) the receptors in apo,\nantagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states explore vastly different\nconformational space; (ii) among the three receptor states the apo state\nexplores the broadest range of microstates; (iii) in the presence of the\nagonist, the active conformation is maintained through coherent couplings among\nthe binary switches; and (iv) to be most specific, our analysis shows that\nW246, located deep inside the binding cleft, can serve as both an agonist\nsensor and actuator of ensuing intramolecular signaling for the receptor\nactivation.Finally, our analysis of multiple trajectories generated by\ninserting an agonist to the apo state underscores that the transition of the\nreceptor from inactive to active form requires the disruption of ionic-lock in\nthe DRY motif.",

    "summary": "The identification and validation of therapeutic antibodies is critical for\ndeveloping effective treatments for many diseases. We present a computational\napproach for identifying antibodies targeting GFRAL-specific receptors,\nreceptors implicated in appetite regulation. Using humanized Trianni mice, we\nconducted a longitudinal study with repeated blood sampling and splenic\nanalysis. We applied the STAR computational method for antibody discovery on\nbulk antibody repertoire data sampled at key time points. By mapping the output\nfrom STAR to single-cell data taken at the last time point, we successfully\nidentified a pool of antibodies, of which 50% demonstrated binding\ncapabilities. We observed convergent selection, where responding sequences with\nidentical amino acid complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) were found in\ndifferent mice. We provide a catalog of 67 experimentally validated antibodies\nagainst GFRAL. The potential of these antibodies as antagonists or agonists\nagainst GFRAL suggests therapeutic solutions for conditions like cancer\ncachexia, anorexia, obesity, and diabetes. This study underscores the utility\nof integrating computational methods and experimental validation for antibody\ndiscovery in therapeutic contexts by reducing time and increasing efficiency.",
